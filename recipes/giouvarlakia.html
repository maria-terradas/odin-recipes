        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>Giouvarlakia is a typical winter soup from Greece.<p>
            <p>The main ingredients are rice and meatballs. It is the perfect dish for a cold winter night</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1\2 kg minced beef</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 Lemons</li>
            <li>Bouillon mix (spices)</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1\2 onion</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Chilly flakes</li>
            <li>Rice (Carolina , Nixaki or glasse) â€“ sushi rice also works</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the minced meat in a bowl and add a tablespoon of salt, a tablespoon of "Maggie"/bouillon flavour, a tablespoon of chilly flakes, half a teaspoon of cumin, a little pepper and an egg. Grate half an onion on the minced meat. Then put three tablespoons of olive oil in the minced meat.</li>

            <li>We measure half a cup of rice (about 170 grams) and rinse it three times with water to remove the starch. We take a pinch (~ 20 grams) of rice and put it in the minced meat.</li>

            <li>By hand, mix the minced meat with the other ingredients and press with your fists. Meanwhile, put 2 litres of water in a saucepan and heat it.</li>

            <li>Make the meatballs: we take a spoonful of minced meat and make balls with our hands.

            <li>When the water is hot, put the meatballs in the pot and boil them. Remove the foam from the surface and add a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of "Maggie"/bouillon flavour and add a little pepper. Cover the pot and cook the soup on low heat.</li>

            <li>After 40 minutes, add three tablespoons of oil and five or six tablespoons of rice. Stir, so that the rice does not stick to the bottom. Boil for 10-15 minutes more.</li>

            <li>Beat three eggs in a bowl with a little salt. Then, we add juice of one and a half lemons. Slowly, take some soup from the pot and carefully put it in the eggnog. Then put more soup in the eggnog and then carefully put all the eggnog in the pot. At the end, try the soup and add salt or lemon juice if desired.</li>
